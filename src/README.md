# Animation.js

<p align="center">

Animation.js is a graphing engine that allows  users to manipulate common mathematical functions and help illustrate the different types of transformations that can be achieved by utilizing this engine. This is an ongoing project developed in React.js and utilizes some of the Material-UI framework. Future endeavors with this project include adding the D3.js framework to help with graphing and additional features that are to be determined.
Please feel free to give feedback or suggest enhancements to this project.
